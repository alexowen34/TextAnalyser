We are as excited as Homer Simpson spotting a trampoline for sale, because Disney+ is here. This means we have on-demand access to more than 600 episodes of The Simpsons for the first time.

The yellow family have been a regular sight on British screens for decades. This is the first time viewers in this country will be able to (legally) chose exactly which episodes they want to watch. Viewers will also be able to watch without the risk of being exposed to some of the newer ones, which have taken the shine off the series somewhat.

To celebrate this new arrangement, we've picked out 16 of the best Simpsons episodes that you can stream right now - our selection skews towards the first decade of the show, for obvious reasons.
