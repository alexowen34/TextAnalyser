The service I received was outstanding! All your employees should be proud. I have now returned home. The flight took around 3 hours. I was throughly impressed on how comfortable the flight was - I'm so so happy with the quality! 

It should be noted that the neighbours were really annoying. It was incredibly dissapointing and I'm very very annoyed! Please can this be passed on to the relevent people. 

Sadly, I also have a complaint about the food... It was disgusting! I can't believe a 4 star hotel would serve this. 

Overall, I would this recommend travel company. But this specific hotel resutrant should be avoided at all costs! 

Thanks, Alex Owen.
