# TextAnalyser

The Text Analyser project is my first desktop application that I have ever created. I built this for a 1st year university project.

The application focuses heavily on string manipulation to display a range of infomation on test the user provides. This includes:

- Parts of Speech Analysis
- Sentiment Analysis
- Word Level Analysis
- Character Level Analysis
